# Melonoma-Detector
As part of my coursework, I developed a binary classification model that differentiates between malign and benign melanoma. To put this into practical use, I converted into a tflite model to be deployed onto a raspberry pi for practicality.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Kaggle Skin Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-malignant-vs-benign)

## Result
